"""Secrets that must not live in a wiki file — currently the Kahala refresh token.

Everything else Jamgraf remembers goes in one of two places: per-wiki rows in the
wiki's own SQLite file, or ``app_config.json`` beside it. Neither can hold a
credential:

* the wiki file **is** the export. "Save wiki" copies that database, and
  ``store.export_wiki_bundle`` reads from it — so a settings row containing a
  refresh token would be handed to whoever you shared a wiki with.
* ``app_config.json`` is plain JSON in the data directory. It never leaves the
  machine on its own, but it is world-readable-to-you plaintext that lands in
  Time Machine and any folder backup.

So credentials go to the macOS Keychain instead, via the ``security`` tool.

What this actually buys, stated honestly
----------------------------------------
The Keychain protects the token **at rest and in transit off the machine**: it
is not in a file you can accidentally export, mail, or commit, and a stolen
backup of the data directory contains nothing to sign in with.

It does **not** protect against code already running as you. A same-user process
can shell out to ``security`` exactly as this module does and read the item back
without a prompt. That is the same trust boundary the rest of the app already
sits on — ``auth.py`` grants loopback callers owner rights — so this is not a new
exposure, and it would be dishonest to describe it as one. Don't write docs that
imply more.

The secret never appears in ``argv``. ``security -i`` reads its commands from
stdin, so the token is not visible in ``ps`` output while the write happens.
That stdin is a *command stream*, though -- one command per line -- so a value
carrying a newline would end the write command and have its remainder read as
the next ``security`` command. The refresh token is minted by the sign-in server,
which makes it the one value here that arrives from off the machine, so values
are checked (:func:`_sendable`) rather than escaped: no quoting makes a newline
part of a word in that parser, and a credential that can't be stored safely must
fail loudly rather than creatively.

No silent fallback
------------------
:func:`available` reports whether there is a real secure store here. When there
isn't — a future Linux or Windows build, or a Mac where ``security`` is missing —
callers must refuse to sign in and say so. Writing the token to a file "just for
now" is exactly the outcome this module exists to prevent, so there is no file
backend to fall back to, not even a hidden one.
