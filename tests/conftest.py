    The app's lifespan does startup work — seeding the Help wiki, the one-time

    when the lifespan exits does **not** stop the thread: instrumenting
    ``db.get_conn`` showed 175 calls arriving *after* a TestClient context
    exited, from a thread named "AnyIO worker thread". Awaiting the cancelled
    tasks does not help either, because the event loop that would wait for the
    thread is being torn down with it.

    In the app that is harmless — nothing swaps its data directory underneath it.
    Under test it is issue #10: those late calls resolve ``config.DATA_DIR`` and
    ``db._local`` while this file's fixtures are restoring them, which surfaces as
    ``apsw.BusyError`` or ``no such table: pages`` in whatever test runs next.
