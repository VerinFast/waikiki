"""A capability the machine can't do must be *reported*, not discovered on click.

The bug these guard: a user without the ``claude`` CLI pressed Chat, waited, and
got an error with a shell command in it to copy. Everything below is one of the
three halves of replacing that — say it before the click, offer a button that
actually fixes it, and be honest when the fix fails.

Nothing here may depend on what is installed on the machine running the suite.
Every process launch and every HTTP call is faked; ``conftest``'s ``_bare_machine``
fixture already makes the default answer "you have nothing", and a test that
wants a tool present says so itself.
