"""Rule 12: every export this app can write, it can read back.

An export you cannot restore is not a backup — it is a file that looks like one,
and the person finds out on the day they need it. That is not hypothetical here:
Kahala's whole-wiki bundle was *produced* by `store.export_wiki_bundle` and
*consumed* by `store.import_wiki_bundle` for a whole release, and still could not
be opened, because the only door a person could reach (`wikis.import_from`) knew
one archive shape and reported a valid bundle as "not a Waikiki wiki file".
Both halves existed and passed their own tests. Nothing checked that the pair
was reachable.

So this file does the checking, and it checks the *surface* rather than any one
round-trip: it discovers every `export*` function in the app and fails on one
that has neither a named importer, a recorded exemption, nor a place on the short
list of known gaps. The round-trips themselves are proved next door
(`test_wiki_bundle.py`, `test_ydoc_interchange.py`, `test_wikis.py`); what is
guarded here is that no *new* export can arrive without its reader.
