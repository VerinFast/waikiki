"""Kahala sync (issue #58): the credential, the wire, and the refusals.

This is an **auth + outbound network** path, so most of what is worth testing
here is what it refuses to do. Two properties are load-bearing enough that the
tests are written to fail if someone "simplifies" them away:

* a bearer token is never handed to a host we did not mean to talk to, which in
  practice means a 3xx is *reported*, never followed (``httpx`` re-sends the
  ``Authorization`` header across a redirect);
* the refresh token never lands in a wiki file or in ``app_config.json``, only
  in the Keychain -- because the wiki file *is* what "Save wiki" exports.

The HTTP fake replaces only the **transport**, never ``kahala._client`` itself.
That is deliberate: patching the client would also replace the arguments the
client is constructed with, and ``follow_redirects=False`` is one of those
arguments. Faking a layer lower means the redirect test exercises the real
setting -- flip it to True in ``kahala._client`` and this file goes red.
