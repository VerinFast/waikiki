# --- The desktop shell's file-dialog filters ----------------------------------
#
# pywebview does not treat a filter string as free text: `parse_file_type`
# matches `^([\w ]+)\((\*...)\)$` and raises `ValueError` on anything else, and
# `Window.create_file_dialog` validates every filter *before* opening a dialog.
# So one comma in a description is an Open button that does nothing — no dialog,
# no error, because the exception escapes the JS-API method and merely rejects
# the promise the page is awaiting. That shipped once, from a label that read
# "Waikiki wiki, bundle or markdown zip".
#
# The pattern is restated here rather than imported: pywebview is a packaging
# dependency, absent from the test venv, and this has to fail in CI too. If
# pywebview ever loosens its own rule, this test is stricter than it needs to
# be, which is the safe direction — it only rejects filters that would not have
# worked before.
