"""The Keychain interface, and what it refuses to hand to ``security``.

Unlike ``test_kahala_sync.py`` — which fakes :mod:`secretstore` wholesale so no
test touches a developer's real Keychain — this exercises the module itself with
``security`` replaced by a recorder. What is being tested is the boundary between
a value we were given and a command interpreter: ``security -i`` reads **one
command per line**, and the refresh token is minted by the sign-in server, which
makes it the one value here that comes from off the machine.
