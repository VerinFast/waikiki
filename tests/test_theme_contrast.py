"""Guards against controls that exist but cannot be seen.

Two bugs shipped past presence assertions and were only caught by looking at a
dark-theme screenshot:

* the lead section's speaker was a bare ``<button>`` with no ``color``, so it
  inherited the UA default black — fine on the light theme, invisible on dark;
* the lead ``edit``/speaker pair carried ``opacity:0`` that only a heading hover
  raised, and the lead strip has no heading, so nothing could ever reveal them.

Asserting an element is in the DOM proves nothing about either. These tests read
the stylesheet instead, because the themes are *variable overrides* on top of
``default.css`` — so a control that hard-codes a colour, or omits one, is
unreadable on some theme by construction.
