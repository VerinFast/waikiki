"""Bug reports an agent filed, queued for a person to review before they go out.

An agent hits a limitation at the moment it has everything needed to describe it
-- the exact tool call, the arguments, the error -- and none of that survives to
a bug report unless it can be captured right there (issue #89). So the MCP server
has a ``report_bug`` tool, and this module is where those reports wait.

Why they wait, rather than being filed
--------------------------------------
Publishing to a public tracker is not the kind of side effect a tool call should
have on its own, and there are two separate reasons, only one of which is about
credentials:

* **The credential.** Filing directly means a GitHub token living in the app.
  We have somewhere safe to put one now (:mod:`secretstore`), so this is
  possible -- but a tool call that can publish to a public tracker is a
  different class of power from one that syncs the user's own wiki, and the
  cheapest way to get that wrong is to build it at all.
* **What ends up in the report.** An agent is at maximum context exactly when it
  is most likely to paste *wiki content* into one -- a failing ``edit_page``
  carries the page's text with it. On a public tracker that is a privacy leak,
  not merely noise, and no amount of prompting reliably prevents it. A person
  reading the report before it is submitted is the actual mitigation.

So nothing here reaches the network. :func:`github_url` builds a link that
pre-fills GitHub's own *new issue* form; the person clicks it, reads what is
about to be published in GitHub's editor, and submits it themselves. No token,
no publishing from a tool call, and the review step is somewhere they cannot
miss it.

Storage is ``DATA_DIR/bug_reports.json`` -- app-global, deliberately not the
wiki's own database, which is per-wiki and is what "Save wiki" exports.
