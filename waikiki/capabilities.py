"""What this install can actually do — and the button that fixes what it can't.

Until now a user without the ``claude`` CLI found out by pressing **Chat**,
waiting, and reading an error with a shell command in it to copy. That is
backwards twice over: the answer was knowable *before* the click, and "here is a
command" is not a remedy, it is homework.

This module answers both halves. It probes every optional capability and returns
a state, a plain-language reason, and — where one exists — a **remedy
descriptor**: a stable id the routes can execute, a label for a button, and what
the user is being asked to agree to. Never a string of shell to paste.

Four rules hold it together.

*Report the chain, not the destination.* A remedy has prerequisites of its own.
Offering "install the Claude Code CLI" on a machine with no ``npm`` is the same
dead end in a new place, so every remedy resolves to the step that is
**actionable now**: no npm means the offer becomes Node.js, and no way to
install Node either means we say so plainly instead of pretending.

*Never invent an install.* Where no vendor publishes one, the capability says it
needs manual setup and points at the setting that changes it. An honest "we
can't fix this for you" beats a fabricated command that may not work.

*A script piped into a shell is not a package install.* ``curl … | bash`` runs
whatever the host sends back, with nothing verifying it — a long way from
``updater.py``, which refuses to execute a release it has not Ed25519-verified
against a build-time-pinned key (CLAUDE.md rule 8). We still offer the button,
because a command to copy is no safer and much less usable, but the URL is a
constant in this file (never a setting, never anything a caller supplies), the
host is named to the user before anything happens, and it runs only from a
deliberate click plus a confirmation — never from a probe or a page render.

*Doorman is never remedied.* It is the user's own app: detected, described,
never installed and never started (``docs/doorman.md``). Its row here carries no
button, deliberately.

What may actually be *run* lives next door in :mod:`waikiki.remedies` — this
module decides which step is actionable, that one owns what is executable at all
and is the only place an argv is written.

The shape follows ``doorman.status()`` and ``updater.status()``, the existing
precedent: a module below the routes reports, Settings renders, POST routes act.
