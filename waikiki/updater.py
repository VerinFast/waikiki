"""Self-update for the packaged Waikiki.app.

A running .app cannot overwrite its own bundle, so an update is always:
download -> verify -> stage -> hand off to a detached helper -> quit -> the
helper swaps the bundle and relaunches. The helper has to outlive the process
that spawned it, which is why it is a standalone script and not a thread.

User data is never touched. Wikis live in ``config.DATA_DIR``
(~/Library/Application Support/Waikiki), outside the bundle, so an update
replaces code only. A backup still runs first: schema migrations are
forward-only, so an older binary may not understand a newer wiki.

Trust model
-----------
The bundle is unsigned (``codesign_identity=None`` in waikiki.spec), so macOS
gives us no authenticity guarantee about a downloaded zip. This code path
downloads a blob and then executes it as the user, which makes it the highest
privilege path in the app -- HTTPS protects the transport, not the artifact.

So we carry our own trust root: every release zip must be signed with an
Ed25519 key whose *public* half is pinned in ``PUBLIC_KEY_HEX`` below. The
private half never lives in this repo. An unsigned payload, a payload signed
by another key, or a payload that does not match its signature is refused --
and if no public key is pinned, updating is disabled entirely rather than
falling back to trusting the download. Fail closed, always: the failure mode of
getting this wrong is arbitrary code execution on every install.

# Ed25519 public keys (64 hex chars each) that release zips must verify against.
# A release needs to satisfy ONE of them.
#
# Generate a keypair with scripts/release.sh --genkey. Paste the PUBLIC half
# here and commit it; keep the private half outside the repo (the script reads
# it from WAIKIKI_UPDATE_KEY). An empty set means "updates disabled" -- see
# _pinned_keys(). Never populate this from the network or from app config: a
# pinned key an attacker can rewrite is not a trust root.
#
# WHY A SET AND NOT ONE KEY. Each build trusts what is pinned into it, for its
# whole life. With a single key there is no way out of either disaster: lose the
# private half and every copy in the field can never take another update, and
# there is no revoking a stolen one -- those copies will accept whatever it signs
# until each is reinstalled by hand. A set makes rotation possible without
# abandoning anyone: publish a build trusting {current, next}, wait for it to
# spread, start signing with `next`, and later drop `current`. That overlap only
# exists if the shipped builds already carry more than one slot, which is why
# this is a tuple today, while the only installs are ours.
#

# key. Successors are appended, never inserted.
