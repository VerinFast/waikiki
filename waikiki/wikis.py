"""Wiki registry — the list of isolated wikis and which is the default.

Each wiki is a separate SQLite file (``data/wikis/<slug>.db``). Physical
separation is what guarantees the isolation the app promises: a page in one
wiki can never link to or surface a page in another, because every lookup,
search, and ``[[wiki link]]`` resolves against a single wiki's database.

The registry itself is a small JSON file (``data/wikis.json``) read fresh on
each call so the web app and the (separate-process) MCP server always agree.

    (`db.invalidate_connections`): they are per (thread, wiki) and a stale one

    thread cached before the move stays usable until that thread next calls
    `get_conn`, so a write committing through one *between* the copy and the

    removes the writer that runs on its own schedule (the collab flusher); what
    is left is an HTTP request writing to this wiki in the same moment somebody
    renames it. Closing that properly means a lock every save takes forever, to
    buy safety in an admin action taken once — so it is written down here and in

# --- Markdown: a folder of <slug>.md, and the reader that takes it back ------
#
# Markdown is the lossy, portable shape: text only, one file per page, meant to
# land in a repo's `docs/` where a person edits it with everything else. Rule 12
# still applies — if the app can write wiki state to a file it must read that
# file back — so what the export writes has to be enough to reconstruct the
# pages it came from, and the two halves live next to each other here.
#
# That is why the exported file carries a frontmatter *header*. The body alone
# does not name the page: the slug is in the filename, but the title is a column
# and Waikiki resolves `[[links]]` by title, so a wiki restored from filenames
# alone comes back with its links pointing at pages that no longer answer to
# those names. `title:` costs one line and fixes that; `parent:` costs one line
# on child pages and is the difference between markdown export being flat and it
# round-tripping the hierarchy, so both are written and both are read back as
# structure rather than as page properties (`structure.STRUCTURAL_KEYS`).
#
# What markdown does *not* carry is everything that is not page text: images,
# history, comments, suggestions, templates, elements, the trash, manual order
# and starred flags. A `.wiki` file or a bundle is the faithful copy; this is
# the one for a repo. `docs/export-import-parity.md` names the limits.
